# Similarity Score Feature for Codebase Analyzer

## Overview

This feature enhances the codebase analyzer by displaying similarity scores (relevance percentages) for each file and code chunk when answering questions. This helps users understand which parts of the codebase are most relevant to their queries.

## Changes Made

1. Modified the `query` method in `analyzer.py` to:
   - Calculate and store similarity scores in chunk metadata
   - Display search process information to the user
   - Show the number of relevant code sections found

2. Enhanced the `_build_enhanced_context` method to:
   - Sort files by average similarity score
   - Display file relevance percentages
   - Sort chunks within each file by relevance
   - Show chunk relevance percentages

3. Updated the `_build_simple_context` method to:
   - Sort files and chunks by relevance
   - Display relevance percentages for files and chunks

## Benefits

- **Transparency**: Users can see which files and code sections are most relevant to their queries
- **Improved Understanding**: The relevance scores help users understand why certain code is being shown
- **Better Navigation**: Files and chunks are sorted by relevance, putting the most important information first

## Example Output

```
Searching for relevant code to answer: How does the data processing work?
Using 20 chunks for context
Found 20 relevant code sections
File: file1.py Relevance: 33.44%
  Chunk lines 1-9 Relevance: 38.21%
  Chunk lines 10-12 Relevance: 28.67%
File: file2.py Relevance: 26.75%
  Chunk lines 9-13 Relevance: 28.41%
  Chunk lines 1-8 Relevance: 25.08%
```

## Implementation Details

The similarity scores are calculated using a combination of:
1. Embedding distance (converted to similarity using 1/(1+distance))
2. Chunk importance based on code structure (classes, functions, etc.)
3. Relevance to the query context (type of question, code elements mentioned)

The scores are displayed as percentages to make them more intuitive for users.

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements to this feature could include:
- Color-coding relevance scores (e.g., green for high relevance, yellow for medium, red for low)
- Adding a minimum threshold to filter out low-relevance chunks
- Allowing users to adjust the number of chunks shown based on relevance
- Providing a visual representation of relevance (e.g., bar charts)
